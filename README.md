This is a very simple program of a voting system.

All the program does is take the age of the candiate input and then using if else logic finds out if the candidate is eligible for voting or not.

If the inputted age is above 18, the canditate is eligible for voting.
If the inputted age is less than 18, the program prints that the candidate is eligible for voting and also prints the number of years required by the candidate to become
eligible for voting.
